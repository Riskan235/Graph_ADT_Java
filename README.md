# Graph_ADT_Java
A Graph Abstract Data Type that I implemented in Java, which supports Generic, adding nodes and edges, as well as performing Breadth-First Search and Dijkstra's Algorithm.

This ADT is well documented with appropriate Abstract Function, Representation Invariant, and checkRep() functions.
